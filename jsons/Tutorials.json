Accumulating enough [Exhibits] allows players to exchange them for Expo rewards: [Industrial Exhibition], [Technology Exhibition], and [Cultural Exhibition]. However, rewards can only be redeemed during the Expo period, and since rewards are limited, you must compete with other civilizations in this international event."
